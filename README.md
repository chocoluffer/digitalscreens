# Digital Screens -- README in progress
Created for the use of Miami University's culinary department, developed July-August 2016

This is a simple program designed to display nutritional information across Miami University's campus. When I was managing it, it was being used in five dining buildings with twenty-three different variations.

# Background
"ver3.php" contains the functions used by the pages. "ver3.php" was the final version I had completely tested prior to leaving my role in the department. "ver4a.php" had the start of changes I had hoped to make, but ultimately didn't have time to complete. A lot of these changes were cleaning up wet code and additional features I hoped to add. Alas, time wasn't on my side.

"main.css" contains the universal styling for the pages. Each page required it's own tweaks due to vastly different screen sizes and requirements.

I had certain limitations due to working with the University:
* I was not given direct access to the University's database, and had to parse my information from text dumps (the source of which I had no access to)
* I was instructed to write it in PHP (I had never looked at or used PHP previously)
* Each screen required it's own unique link due to the system's antiquated set-up
* I was the sole developer in the department, and the IT department was overwhelmed and unable to provide any assistance after setting up the data dumps.
* I was also handling all the University's website edits during this time, so I wasn't able to go back and clean up a lot of the wet things I did while getting it to work, as it was needed by the start of school (mid August).
